No matter why or when you visit us, we provide comprehensive and excellent care.<br/>In 2005, we supervised the first general practice residency. In the meantime, there have been 14 colleagues who have accompanied us for between six and 24 months.<br/>Since 2007, we have been giving lectures and seminars at the University of Bonn in the training of medical students. These often come to our practice for internships and clinical traineeships.<br/>Also students of the practical year (PJ) are trained here at the end of their studies in the so-called elective subject of general medicine.</div></li>

    <h3>General medicine</h3><div><details><summary>We offer family medicine diagnostics, therapy, preventive care, services and &#x2026; &#x2328;</summary>Consultation as well as continuous further care and support in the sense of a first point of contact in all health-related questions and problems. <br/><br/>In addition to the anamnesis (questioning about complaints), the physical examination, we offer the following diagnostic equipment <br/><br/>* Ultrasound of abdominal organs and thyroid <br/>* ECG, long-term and stress ECG <br/>* 24-hour blood pressure measurement <br/>* Pulmonary function test <br/>* Urine, stool and blood tests <br/><br/>The standard services also include - in medically justified cases - and in the context of many years of care for seniors and less mobile patients= the home visit! <br/><br/>We also provide care in retirement homes, nursing homes and short-term care, working closely with nursing services. <br/><br/>For chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD), lung diseases (COPD, asthma) and diabetes, continuous care is provided as part of the DMP (Disease Management Program) of the health insurance companies. <br/><br/>If necessary, we organize further treatment with other specialists, clinics or rehabilitation centers.</details></div></li><li>
    <h3>Osteopathy</h3><div><details><summary>Osteopathic medicine for painful dysfunctions of the musculoskeletal system &#x2026;  &#x2328;</summary> The aim of this treatment method is to identify functional problems of the musculoskeletal system through manual diagnostics and to treat them accordingly in the same manual way.<br/><br/>Integrated into the holistic view of the patient&apos;s problem, osteopathic treatment is a focus of Dr. Matthias de Boer.<br/><br/>Increasingly, the statutory health insurance companies reimburse the costs in whole or in part. An initial examination to assess whether this form of therapy could be promising is of course possible within the framework of normal health insurance medical care. </details></div></li><li>
    <h3>Shock wave therapy</h3><div><details><summary>for (long-lasting) musculoskeletal pain. This form of therapy &#x2026; &#x2328;</summary> became known through the possibility of smashing kidney stones from the outside (extracorporeally). This involves the use of acoustic waves, such as those generated by explosive processes. If these waves hit an obstacle, they also have an effect far away from the point of origin (think, for example, of the bursting of a window pane after an explosion). This physical principle is used in the treatment of kidney stones. The shock wave is directed through the body in the direction of the kidney stone, penetrates further with little damage to the hard material of the stone and often causes its destruction.<br/><br/>We use our shock wave therapy device (focused or radial) for orthopedic indications. In this case, exact localization is possible based on the patient&apos;s indication of pain. Depending on the indication, different types of shock waves are applied to this area, and the strength and frequency are also varied. This triggers complex processes, the details of which are not yet fully understood, and often leads to an improvement in the symptoms.<br/><br/>As a rule, one to five treatments are performed. They usually last a few (to a maximum of 20) minutes and are sometimes very painful, with constant communication with the practitioner (biofeedback) and, if necessary, the energy strength of the device is adjusted. The interval between treatments is usually 5-14 days, in the meantime there should be no painful stress on the treated region and sufficient fluids should be supplied.<br/><br/>Shockwave therapy is not a benefit of public health insurance, even private insurance does not cover every such treatment. The cost is, depending on the use and duration of the different types of shock waves 30 - 200 euros per session. <br/><br/><h3>Indication examples</h3><br/>Generally, shock wave therapy is more indicated for chronic problems of the musculoskeletal system. The following diseases, for example, come into question<br/><br/>&#x2460;&#x21e2;Tennis elbow - (epicondylitis humeri radialis) <br/>&#x2461;&#x21e2;Golfer&apos;s elbow - (epicondylitis humeri ulnaris) <br/>&#x2462;&#x21e2;Heel spur - (fasciitis plantaris, plantar fasciitis), if necessary. also with inflammation of the plantar fascia <br/>&#x2463;&#x21e2;calc shoulder - (tendinosis calcarea)<br/>&#x2464;&#x21e2;hip pain - (trochanter syndron), due to irritation of the large rolling mound on the outside of the upper thigh - <br/>&#x2465;&#x21e2;muscle problems such as tension, injuries </details></div></li><li>
    <h3>Acupuncture</h3><div><details><summary>placement of needles according to Chinese teachings, ear acupuncture according to Paul Nogier &#x2026; &#x2328;</summary> A number of diseases respond well to this therapy, which is somewhat painful when inserted, but has very few side effects. We mainly treat patients with the following conditions, spinal pain, joint pain, allergies, asthma, headaches, stress/exhaustion. <br/><br/>For chronic back pain and knee joint wear and tear, public health insurance will cover the cost of acupuncture. <br/><br/>Please allow sufficient time for an acupuncture session. As a rule, they lie about 30 minutes on a couch, if necessary with a blanket, listen to music and should be as relaxed as possible. </details></div></li><li>
    <h3>Chirotherapy</h3><div><details><summary>Chirotherapy uses hand grips to resolve pain or movement disorders &#x2026; &#x2328;</summary> The essential goal of the various grip techniques is to treat and improve disturbed joint functions. Malpositions in the area of joints can cause discomfort that sometimes initially makes one think of other diseases. For example, a blocked rib on the left side of the chest may cause such pain that the patient thinks of a heart attack. <br/><br/>The goal of chiropractic therapy is the manipulative correction of this malposition. At times embedded in other forms of therapy, a normalization of the movement sequence and thus a decrease in pain symptoms can be achieved. </details></div></li><li>
    <h3>Sports medicine</h3><div><details><summary>Diagnostics and sports consulting We love sports &#x2026; &#x2328;</summary> We have tried, also in the context of our sports medicine training, a wide range of different sports, the following also practiced over a period of years.<br/><ul><br/>* Jogging<br/>* Hiking<br/>* Swimming<br/>* Tennis<br/>* Squash<br/>* Cycling (road bike, mountain bike, trekking tours)<br/>* Football<br/>* Volleyball<br/>* Basketball<br/>* Table tennis<br/>* Vaulting<br/>* Gymnastics<br/>* High diving<br/>* Trampolining<br/>* Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll Dancing</ul>.<br/>Due to our advanced age, the last five are only very rarely on the program, the others show up regularly in the schedule (we both do sports almost every day).<br/><br/>The joy of exercise often shows up in the consultations in our practice. According to the motto &quot;movement is life&quot; we try to motivate our environment. Our special knowledge of different types of exercise makes it possible to recommend to almost every patient, no matter what illness or injury, a workout that can bring joy - and strengthen body and mind for the diverse demands of life in our society.<br/><br/>If desired, we also perform sports fitness examinations. In addition to the mandatory examinations (e.g. for diving or admission to a sports university), you can have us assess your state of health before taking up a sport, or document improvements in your performance during the course of sporting activity.<br/><br/>The diving sports examination takes place according to the rules of the Society for Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine ( http://www.gtuem.org). </details></div></li>

    <h3>Career at BdB</h3><div><br/>We have been training since August 2003. In the meantime, 10 MFAs (medical assistants), 16 doctors and 18 students in their practical year have successfully completed their training with us.</div></li>

  
</ul>     
      <ul class="grid2">
  <li>
    <h3>Medical Assistant (MFA)</h3><div><br/>In relation to MFA training, it should be mentioned that our employee Ms. Petra Fiest has taken over the leadership in this regard due to manifold advanced training in a wide variety of fields. In addition, she also works as an examiner for MFA trainees at the Medical Association. The entire spectrum of activities of a general medical practice is taught. This includes, but is not limited to, communication (in person and by phone), registration, practical skills (drawing blood, performing EKGs, long-term blood pressure measurements and pulmonary function tests, on-site testing of blood and urine), handling inquiries, preparing prescriptions/referrals/referrals/etc., <br/>manifold communication with health care providers (e.g., specialty practices, hospitals, laboratory medicine, physical therapy, nursing services, retirement homes).</div></li><li>
    <h3>Doctors</h3><div><br/>If we already work in the most interesting profession in the world, we would like to practice this as well and with as much joy as possible. A good working atmosphere, in which everyone participates every day, makes it (mostly) possible.</div></li><li>
    <h3>Students</h3><div><br/>As part of our activities as a teaching practice and lecturer, students in the practical year in the elective subject of general medicine are primarily trained with us. Unfortunately, we can only very seldom make appointments for clinical clerkships and block internships, as we do not want to supervise more than one student at a time. We attach great importance to the optimization of anamnestic arts (including the communication thereby) and physical examination methods. Further diagnostics (laboratory, ECG, LuFu, LZ-RR, sono abdomen and thyroid) can be performed generously if indicated, therapeutic measures should primarily include counseling on healthy lifestyle. We try to minimize medication use as much as possible through specific counseling.</div></li><li>
    <h3>Application</h3><div><br/>Apply. The best way is to call us (if necessary via answering machine 02224 9014712) and we will discuss the possibilities of cooperation.</div></li>
